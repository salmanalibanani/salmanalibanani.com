Wordpress is great.  When I started to take blogging seriously a few months ago, I decided to keep things as simple as possible.  I think that Wordpress.com was a good choice at that time.  I could focus on content, and don't worry too much about anything else.  The nice HTML editor allowed me to do pretty much what I wanted to do.  But I soon realised that it was a bit of an overkill for what I was trying to do.  I was paying for the premium features and hardly using any of those.

I looked around for alternatives, and finally settled for the zero cost combo of <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.
