Don't get me wrong.  Wordpress is great.  

When I started to take blogging seriously a few months ago, I decided to keep things as simple as possible.  I think that Wordpress.com was a good choice at that time.  I could focus on content, and not worry too much about anything else.  The nice HTML editor allowed me to do pretty much everything I wanted to do, and I am not ashamed of uisng an HTML editor!  

But I soon realised that it was a bit of an overkill for what I was doing.  I was paying for the premium features and hardly using any of those.

I looked around for alternatives, and finally settled for the zero-cost combo of <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.

I love the workflow.  I write my posts in VSCode, preview them locally using Hugo's built-in server, and push changes to my Github repo.  Netlify builds and deploys the whole thing in seconds.  You get 300 build minutes and 100GB bandwidth per-month from Netlify.  I don't think I'll ever need more than that.

There were a few steps involved in migration from Wordpress.  The Hugo theme that I am using needed some tweaks.  It's not the most elegant theme in the world though, and I'll probably change it soon, but it works for now.  I also wanted to retain the url schemes of my site on Wordpress.com.  All the tweaks and content migration took me a couple of hours.  DONE!

Hugo obviously offers much more than what I am currently using.  I will keep exploring, and right now I am loving the new workflow and the blazing fast speed.
