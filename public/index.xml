      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. Wordpress is great.
When I started to take blogging seriously a few months ago, I decided to keep things as simple as possible. I think that Wordpress.com was a good choice at that time. I could focus on content, and not worry too much about anything else. The nice HTML editor allowed me to do pretty much everything I wanted to do, and I am not ashamed of uisng an HTML editor!</description>

      <description>Azure Key Vault is a service that you can use to store application secrets and keys. You can store tokens, connection strings, certificates, API keys etc. in a Key Vault, and it provides a secured location with all usual safegaurds (encryption, access control etc.) that you would expect from such a solution.
In a previos post, I showed a simple technique to store the access credentials of a resource (e.</description>

      <title>Philosophy for Software Developers</title>

      <description>Science is what we know and Philosophy is what we don&amp;rsquo;t know.
(Bertrand Russell)
 Software developers should have some familiarity with the ultimate philosophical questions that have been asked over the last 2000 years, and how great thinkers and writers of the past have tried to answer those questions.
My own interest in philosophy began many years ago, when I came across this quote by Russell:
 I think nobody should be certain of anything.</description>

      <title>Storing Secrets in Azure Key Vault from Azure Devops Release Pipeline</title>

      <description>Azure Key Vault is a service that you can use to store application secrets and keys. You can store tokens, connection strings, certificates, API keys etc. in a Key Vault, and it provides a secured location with all usual safegaurds (encryption, access control etc.) that you would expect from such a solution. You would also expect that such solution should be easy to integrate with your build/release pipelines. Azure Key Vault turns out to be an obvious option if Azure happens to be your platform of choice.</description>

      <title>Scrum and Empiricism</title>

      <description>“Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.”
What? Empiricism?
The first time I read this sentence in the Scrum Guide, I was quite impressed. As a self-professed pseudo-philosopher, I had a vague understanding of philosophical questions on which empiricists and rationalists generally disagree with each other. It’s an ongoing argument in the history of human thought. To confuse the matters further, technically you can be a rationalist in one area (say mathematics) and an empiricist in another area of physical sciences.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Not Just the Bell Curve</title>

      <description>The Bell Curve is our friend. In a recent post, I argued that in Scrum teams the story point estimates work very well because we will inevitably overestimate effort required for certain stories and underestimate effort for others. The net effect is that the overestimates will cancel out the underestimates in the long run.
But, there is something else that goes on in a Scrum team, that makes our estimates more accurate.</description>

      <title>Story Points - A Mathematical Perspective</title>

      <description>In sprint planning meetings, The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. This often involves estimating the effort required to complete work on user stories. Story points are an abstract measure of the effort required to complete a story, and it’s fascinating to me how a set of educated guesses turns out to be a fairly accurate estimate of the effort required to meet sprint goals.</description>
