      <description>Science is what we know and Philosophy is what we don&amp;rsquo;t know.
(Bertrand Russell)
 Software developers should have some familiarity with the ultimate philosophical questions that have been asked over the last 2000 years, and how great thinkers and writers of the past have tried to answer those questions.
My own interest in philosophy began many years ago, when I came across this quote by Russell:
 I think nobody should be certain of anything.</description>

      <description>“Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.”
What? Empiricism?
The first time I read this sentence in the Scrum Guide, I was quite impressed. As a self-professed pseudo-philosopher, I had a vague understanding of philosophical questions on which empiricists and rationalists generally disagree with each other. It’s an ongoing argument in the history of human thought. To confuse the matters further, technically you can be a rationalist in one area (say mathematics) and an empiricist in another area of physical sciences.</description>
