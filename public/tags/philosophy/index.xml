      <description>“Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.”
What? Empiricism?
The first time I read this sentence in the Scrum Guide, I was quite impressed. As a self-professed pseudo-philosopher, I had a vague understanding of philosophical questions on which empiricists and rationalists generally disagree with each other. It’s an ongoing argument in the history of human thought. To confuse the matters further, technically you can be a rationalist in one area (say mathematics) and an empiricist in another area of physical sciences.</description>
